My name is Ryan Batchelder, I’m a cloud architect and [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) helping people build resilient cloud-native web applications using modern technologies at Liberty Mutual Insurance. I graduated from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ but I now cheer on the Boston Bruins 🏒 (and the rest of our sports teams) from my home state of Massachusetts. In my time away from the keyboard, I enjoy everything tech, hockey, and am an unapologetic aviation geek.
