My name is Ryan Batchelder and Iâ€™m a cloud architect helping people build resilient cloud-native web applications using modern technologies at Liberty Mutual Insurance. I got my BS in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University. In my time away from the keyboard, I enjoy everything tech, hockey, and am an unapologetic aviation geek.
